# Bailey's NixOS configuration

This configuration depends on other private repositories (from MonashNovaRover). Don't try to use it!

It fixes problems with certain applications and hardware I use.

#### TODO
- [ ] Make packages dir
- [ ] Put all my packages into overlays
- [ ] Add an overlay at overlays/default.nix that combines my different overlays
