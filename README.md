# Bailey's NixOS configuration

This configuration is terrible, and depends on other private repositories. Don't try to use it!

It fixes problems with certain applications and hardware I use.

#### TODO
- [ ] Make an overlay
- [ ] Make profiles so I can reuse this on other devices
- [ ] Fix screen sharing on zoom and discord
- [ ] Make obsidian boot with wayland flags
